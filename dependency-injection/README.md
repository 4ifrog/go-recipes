# Dependency Injection in Go

Recipes demonstrating dependency injection (DI) in Go. The idea is to implement DI three different ways:

* [No DI framework](no-framework) - Basic DI implemented using Go, no third-party DI framework.
* [Using the Dig framework](dig) - how to leverage the Dig DI framework that injects dependencies at runtime.
* [Using the Wire framework](wire) - how to leverage the Wire DI framework that generate code that injects dependencies at compile time.
