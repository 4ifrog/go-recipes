# Simple Context in Go

A simple implementation of context with timeout.

This is the standard design pattern for a simple concurrent task execution using context timeout. This is a powerful way for executing tasks concurrently without some control especially with some timeout so that the program can move on if the task exceeds the time limit.

## Setup

1. Run the program

   ```bash
   $ go run main.go
   ```
