# Basic CSV Parsing

A simple recipe for reading and parsing a CSV file.

The `encoding/csv` package in the standard Go library provides the parser you need to parse CSV. Use the function `Read()` to read and parse a record from an instance of `Reader`. Make sure you handle the returned error for `io.EOF`, which in my opinon isn't really an error but a state condition.

## Setup

1. Run the program

   ```bash
   $ make run
   ```
